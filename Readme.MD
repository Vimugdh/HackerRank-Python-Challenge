This repository contains the solutions of the Python challenge on HackerRank. The names of the files correspond to the names of the challenges on HackerRank. They don't contain the problem statements however. One shall have to visit the problems on HackerRank in order to view the problem statements. I shall probably add links to the problems in the docstrings if I find the time in the near (or far) future. 
Since Python2 is officially a legacy now, all the code is written in Python3. You might need numpy installed for some of the problems otherwise the rest all use built-in modules.
